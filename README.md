Meet Malak, an opensource performance insights management tool for startups and their investors.

Angelist Raise, Carta and other tools are awesome to communicate with investors. However, these tools are very
limited in terms of control and customization. Or can cost thousands of $ to run and still be
limited to certain features subsets. Or have your data being used [to cross-sell to other businesses for
their own gain](https://x.com/karrisaarinen/status/1743398553500971331)

That's where Malak comes in. Self-hosted on your own infra or hosted by us.
White-label by design. Ready to be deployed on your own domain.
Own full control of your data and company state if you decide to selfhost.
